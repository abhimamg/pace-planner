# Diagram Summaries

The following summaries are inferred from the project documentation in the `planning/` directory, as direct image analysis was not possible.

## 1. capability.pdf_page_0.png
This diagram illustrates the functional capabilities of the rigid pipe configurator system. Based on the Project Charter and PRD, it likely depicts features such as:
- **Single Pipe Configuration**: Design of individual pipe segments.
- **Cross Section Design**: Detailed view and modification of pipe cross-sections.
- **Wall Thickness Calculation**: Engineering calculations for structural integrity.

## 2. tables.pdf_page_0.png
This diagram represents the data model or database schema supporting the application. It likely includes tables for:
- **Pipes**: Storing unique identifiers (`pipe_id`) and properties.
- **Materials**: Specifications for different pipe materials.
- **Dimensions**: Wall thickness, diameter, and length parameters.
- **Configurations**: Saved user configurations and project metadata.
This aligns with the data structures mentioned in the Interface Control Document (ICD).

## 3. workpackages.pdf_page_0.png
This diagram outlines the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for the project. It likely breaks down the development process into key phases:
- **Phase 1: Initiation/Research**: Feasibility studies and initial planning.
- **Phase 2: Design/Planning**: Architecture and detailed requirements.
- **Phase 3: Execution/Development**: Core logic implementation and UI/UX development.
- **Phase 4: Verification/Testing**: Unit testing and UAT.

## 4. workpackages_tree.pdf_page_0.png
This diagram provides a hierarchical tree view of the Work Breakdown Structure, showing the parent-child relationships between phases, deliverables, and specific tasks, offering a structured overview of the project plan.
