# Work Breakdown Structure (WBS): [Project Name]

This WBS is structured based on the inferred phases and tasks from the project diagrams ( `diagrams/workpackages.pdf_page_0.png` and `diagrams/workpackages_tree.pdf_page_0.png`).

## 1. Phase 1: Initiation/Research
- **Feasibility Studies**: Initial assessment of technical and operational viability.
- **Initial Planning**: Scope definition and resource allocation.
- **Requirements Gathering**: Stakeholder interviews and documentation.

## 2. Phase 2: Design/Planning
- **Architecture Design**: High-level system design and component definitions.
- **Detailed Requirements**: Comprehensive PRD and user stories.
- **Database Schema Design**: Defining tables and relationships (Pipes, Materials, Dimensions).

## 3. Phase 3: Execution/Development
- **Core Logic Implementation**: Calculation engines (e.g., Wall Thickness).
- **UI/UX Development**: Configuration interfaces (Single Pipe, Cross Section).
- **API Development**: Backend endpoints for data management.

## 4. Phase 4: Verification/Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Component-level testing.
- **Integration Tests**: Verifying data flow between UI and API.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Stakeholder validation.
