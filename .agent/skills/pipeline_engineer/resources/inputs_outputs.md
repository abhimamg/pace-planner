# Pipeline Engineering Inputs and Outputs

This table defines the required inputs and expected outputs for common subsea pipeline engineering workscopes.

| Workscope | Required Inputs | Expected Outputs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pipeline Design Basis** | Project Location, Design Life, Fluid Composition, Metocean Data (Waves/Currents), Bathymetry, Soil Data. | Documented design criteria, codes of practice, environmental conditions, and material selection philosophy. |
| **Wall Thickness Sizing** | Design Pressure (Internal/External), Water Depth, Material Grade, Corrosion Allowance, Temperature, Diameter. | Sized wall thickness for Pressure Containment, Local Buckling (Collapse), and Propagation Buckling. |
| **On-Bottom Stability** | Metocean Data (Return Periods), Pipeline OD, Concrete Weight Coating (if any), Soil Type (Friction/Stiffness). | Required submerged weight, static/dynamic stability verification, concrete coating thickness. |
| **Expansion Analysis** | Operating Temp/Pressure, Soil Interaction Parameters, End Connections (PLET/Manifold), Route Geometry. | Axial displacements at ends, equivalent stress checks along the line, expansion loop requirements. |
| **Free Span Assessment** | Bathymetry (Seabed Profile), Current Velocities, Structural Properties, Soil Stiffness. | Allowable span lengths for static and fatigue (VIV) limit states, span correction requirements. |
| **Crossing Design** | Existing Infrastructure Data, Route Alignment, Soil Data, Protection Requirements. | Crossing configuration, separation distance, protection method (Grout bags, Concrete mattresses). |
| **Global Buckling** | Thermal/Pressure Loads, Soil Friction, Imperfeciton Profile (Seabed/Installation). | Critical buckling force, post-buckling strain verification, mitigation strategies (e.g., sleepers). |
